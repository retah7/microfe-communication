# microfe-communication
This project explains how micro-frontends are going to communicate to each other using a custom EventBus. 

The example has two react app. One is a monolythic React 14 app along with which we have a new Micro-Frontend(Microfe) which is React 16 app. The existing app is going to act as a stitching layer too to run the Microfe.
